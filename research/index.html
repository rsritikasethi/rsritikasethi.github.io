<strong>&quot;A comment on Dincecco et al. &#40;2022&#41;: Pre-Colonial Warfare and Long-Run Development in India&quot;</strong> &#40;<em>published at the <strong>Canadian Journal of Economics</strong></em>&#41; <br>     with  <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/racheljoyforshaw">Rachel Forshaw</a>,     <a href="https://www.uni-goettingen.de/en/661986.html">Tim Olkers</a> and     <a href="">Manali Sovani</a>  <a href="/assets/forshaw_olkers_sethi_sovani.pdf">&#91;paper&#93;</a>

      <i> We test the reproducibility and replicability of Dincecco et al. (2022), which reports a positive relationship between pre-colonial interstate warfare and long-run development patterns across India. Overall, we confirm that all of the study's estimates are computationally reproducible by using both the provided replication package in Stata and code written by the present authors in R. We test for and find no evidence of data manipulation in the final datasets. Concerning direct replicability, we consider different ways of measuring distance to conflicts and also alternative proxies for both the dependent variable and variables which capture channels by which the main effects operate. We are able to replicate the magnitude and significance of the estimated coefficient on conflict exposure in most of the tests, noting that while most estimates are substantively in line with the original study, some alternative measures of distance to conflict imply different magnitudes for estimates, and proxy estimates are sensitive to both the time period and type of conflict considered.</i>

<strong>&quot;Ignorance is Bliss? Evaluating the Impact of Rank Non-Disclosure on High School Course Choice&quot;</strong>      <a href="/research/">&#91;paper&#93;</a> 
    <details> <summary>  [Abstract] </summary>
      <i> This research develops a dynamic model of learning to analyze how high school students make course choices based on feedback from GPA and class rank, which provide signals about unobserved individual and cohort abilities. Using administrative school district data, the model is estimated with the sequential EM algorithm to account for unobserved heterogeneity in utility and state transitions. Through counterfactual analysis and quasi-experimental evidence, this research investigates the implications of adjusting class rank disclosure—such as full, partial, or delayed disclosure—on students’ course selection behavior. The findings provide valuable insights for policymakers, especially in Texas, where class rank is critical for university admissions, and several school districts are considering non-disclosure.</i>

<strong>&quot;Unraveling Teacher Steering and Student Sorting in Between-School Segregation&#39;s Impact on Within-School Segregation&quot;</strong>      <a href="/assets/sethi_coursechoice_segregation.pdf">&#91;paper&#93;</a> 
    <details> <summary>  [Abstract] </summary>
      <i> This study develops a framework to analyze the impact of between-school segregation on within-school segregation. We model students' course choices as a game of incomplete information, incorporating inter-student and student-teacher interactions. Using idiosyncratic variation in student composition across cohorts in Texas high schools, we find that Black and low SES students receive less encouragement from teachers as their representation increases, suggesting weaker student-teacher interactions. Conversely, Hispanic and female students receive more encouragement with increased representation. White and academically high-performing students are less likely to enroll in college-prep courses as their representation grows, suggesting higher inter-student competition. Additionally, higher expected college-prep enrollment in a cohort discourages students from enrolling, though stronger within-group coordination incentives exist among White, Hispanic, and female students. Policy simulations using an entropy index support the segregation paradox, indicating that racial disparities in course-taking widen in integrated schools. These findings suggest merit in exploring policies like all-girls schools, race-separate courses, and SES desegregation to promote equity in course-taking.</i>

<strong>&quot;If You Build It, They Will Come: A Demand Analysis of Household-Level Childcare Choices&quot;</strong> <br>     with  <a href="https://www.flaviocunha.com">Flávio Cunha</a> and     <a href="https://business.rice.edu/person/jung-youn-lee">Jung Youn Lee</a>  <a href="/research/">&#91;paper&#93;</a> 
    <details> <summary>  [Abstract] </summary>
      <i> This study investigates the phenomenon of childcare deserts by integrating three components. First, we introduce a social planner model that captures the trade-off between maximizing market shares for high-quality programs and prioritizing economically vulnerable locations. Second, we harness a unique dataset that links families with childcare providers, enabling the establishment of proximity-based choice sets and facilitating the estimation of demand for childcare seats. Third, we explore interventions undertaken by two local governments to identify the social planner’s preferences. Our framework offers insights into expansion locations for high-quality programs, while considering potential cannibalization effects.</i>

<strong>&quot;Pharmacy Proximity and Period Poverty: Assessing the Impact of Subsidized Menstrual Product Availability on Menstrual Management and Educational Outcomes&quot;</strong> <br>     with  <a href="https://mishradibya.com">Dibya Mishra</a>  <a href="/assets/mishra_sethi_es24.pdf">&#91;paper&#93;</a> 
    <details> <summary>  [Abstract] </summary>
      <i> This study investigates the impact of providing subsidized sanitary napkins through a nationwide network of generic pharmacies on menstrual hygiene in India. We conduct a difference-in-differences analysis using administrative data, health and education surveys, village infrastructure surveys, and spatial API data. Our results show that subsidized sanitary napkin provision increases usage by 15%, extends schooling years by 6%, and improves learning outcomes by 2%. We highlight the importance of waste management for transitioning from cloth to disposable products, the greater need for these products among women lacking privacy, and the lower adoption rates among women lacking travel autonomy. Moreover, proximity to healthcare or shopping facilities increases adoption, indicating spatial complementarities and emphasizing affordability over mere access.</i>

<strong>&quot;Beyond a Free Lunch: Evaluating the Trade-Offs of an Out-of-School Nutrition Program on Adolescent Girls&#39; Human Capital&quot;</strong> <br>     with  <a href="">Tanmay Devi</a>,     <a href="https://www.ajinkyakeskar.com">Ajinkya Keskar</a> and     <a href="https://mishradibya.com">Dibya Mishra</a>  <a href="/assets/devi_keskar_mishra_sethi.pdf">&#91;paper&#93;</a> 
    <details> <summary>  [Abstract] </summary>
      <i> This study investigates the causal impacts of two iterations of a large-scale nutritional intervention to promote the self-development and empowerment of adolescent girls in India. We use a difference-in-differences strategy to evaluate the program's effects on education and health outcomes. Our findings from the first program iteration reveal that while it successfully reduced the prevalence of anemia among adolescent girls by 2.4%, it also had unintended adverse consequences on their educational attainment. Specifically, the intervention led to an 8% increase in school dropout rates for girls and widened the gender disparity in school enrollment by 6.4%. These negative outcomes are primarily attributed to a program component that conditioned additional nutritional supplements on being out of school. Heterogeneity analysis indicates that these effects were driven by families residing in villages without secondary schools and with low levels of maternal education. In contrast, our evaluation finds that updates made to the scheme during the second iteration do not significantly impact girls' school dropout rates.</i>

<strong>&quot;Mass Reproducibility and Replicability: A New Hope&quot;</strong> <br>     with  <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/abelbrodeur/">Abel Brodeur</a>,     <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/derekmikola/">Derek Mikola</a>,     <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/nikolaimcook/home">Nikolai Cook</a> and others  <a href="/assets/I4R-DP107.pdf">&#91;paper&#93;</a> 
    <details> <summary>  [Abstract] </summary>
      <i> This study pushes our understanding of research reliability by reproducing and replicating claims from 110 papers in leading economic and political science journals. The analysis involves computational reproducibility checks and robustness assessments. It reveals several patterns. First, we uncover a high rate of fully computationally reproducible results (over 85%). Second, excluding minor issues like missing packages or broken pathways, we uncover coding errors for about 25% of studies, with some studies containing multiple errors. Third, we test the robustness of the results to 5,511 re-analyses. We find a robustness reproducibility of about 70%. Robustness reproducibility rates are relatively higher for re-analyses that introduce new data and lower for re-analyses that change the sample or the definition of the dependent variable. Fourth, 52% of re-analysis effect size estimates are smaller than the original published estimates and the average statistical significance of a re-analysis is 77% of the original. Lastly, we rely on six teams of researchers working independently to answer eight additional research questions on the determinants of robustness reproducibility. Most teams find a negative relationship between replicators' experience and reproducibility, while finding no relationship between reproducibility and the provision of intermediate or even raw data combined with the necessary cleaning codes.</i>
